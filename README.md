# nuf.cam

A minimal, mobile-first, Markdown-based notes and todo system — designed not just to *track* what you need to do, but to keep you connected to *why* you're doing it.

## What

`nuf.cam` is a lightweight, browser-based notes app built for clarity and motivation. It supports:

- 📝 **Markdown notes** — easily editable in-browser, stored as plain `.md` files  
- 🔗 **Wiki-style linking** — connect ideas, musings, and todos with `[[links]]`  
- ✅ **Todos** — simple task tracking, designed to stay out of your way  
- 📱 **Mobile-first UI** — fast, minimalist, and easy to use on the go  
- 🧠 **Motivation-first philosophy** — designed to help you stay focused on *why* your tasks matter

## Why

Most productivity tools focus on *what* you should be doing and *when*. But that’s only part of the picture.

`nuf.cam` is designed to help you stay grounded in:

- **Autonomy** — you choose what to work on, not the app  
- **Competence** — you can see your thinking evolve over time  
- **Purpose** — your goals are tied to your thoughts, not just your calendar  
- **Gentle nudges** — when you’re stuck, `nuf.cam` can offer reframes like:  
  > *“You could pause your doomscroll for 4 minutes and put on a load of washing.”*  
  > *“Wouldn’t the bed be even more cosy if the dishes were done?”*  

Not scolding. Not productivity shame. Just thoughtful, supportive reminders — designed to meet you where you are and help you move forward.

This isn’t a second brain. It’s a reminder of *why your brain started all this in the first place*.
